COMP 3010 Assignment  2 report 

Introduction 

An SOC (Security Operations Centre) is a department within an organisation that handles monitoring of their IT systems, and the detection and response to security incidents. This can be done with a type of software called an SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform that it used to investigate these incidents. 

BOTSv3 is a dataset produced by Splunk to be used with their SIEM software to train and test the skills of users. This is done with a series of guided questions that I have answered and will explain in this report. I will also cover the general roles and tiers within an SOC team in relation to the exercise, and discuss the prevention, detection, response, and recovery actions the team would take. I will also cover the process of installing Splunk and preparing the BOTSv3 dataset for use. Finally, I will cover the key lessons I learned during this assignment. 

SOC Roles and Incident Handling 

An SOC makes use of different tiers to effectively make use of the time and different levels of skills of its members. The lowest level is tier 1, usually the most junior members of the team and they would be responsible for day-to-day monitoring of systems, triage, and basic investigation of alerts and, if necessary, escalation of these alerts. Tier 2 members would take charge of the in-depth investigation of an incident, similarly my own role in this BOTSv3 exercise. They would map out a timeline of events, identify root causes such as misconfiguration of permissions, intrusion points, and impact, attempt to contain damage and recommend remediation to higher tiers. Tier 3 would handle the most complex of tasks such as digital forensics, reverse engineering malware, and creating detection and prevention methods. Tier 4, usually the final tier, is responsible for the leadership of the team such as coordinating response to attacks, holistic improvement of practices, and communication with the executive team about any incidents. They would also approve or recommend actions to be taken to recover from the incident.
